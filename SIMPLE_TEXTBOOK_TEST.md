## Chapter 1: Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on 
the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer 
systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

### Key Concepts:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through rewards and penalties
